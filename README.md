It allows to align according to the BME method two input tiers given their timestamps. 

## NOTES
To use the code as is, your input files (one per tier) must be .csv files with at minimum 4 columns:
 1) annotation value
 2) Start time of the annotation
 3) End time of the annotation
 4) Time Duration of the annotation
#While registering these files, please indicate the name of these columns.

The output file results into a csv file ordered with the BME method.
